# KA New Stathis

KA New Stathis is a typeface imitating the style of scores written by Professor Grigorios Stathis from the University of Athens. While KA Old Stathis tries to closely mimic Grigorios' font, KA New Stathis elongates some neumes to better suite long English syllables that might be placed below them.

This font is designed for typing Byzantine Music Scores using [Kassia](https://github.com/t-bullock/Kassia), but can be used in any word processor or text editor.
