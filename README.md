# KA New Stathis

KA New Stathis is a typeface imitating the style of scores written by Professor Grigorios Stathis from the University of Athens.

This font is designed for typing Byzantine Music Scores using the program [Kassia](https://github.com/t-bullock/Kassia), but can be used in any word processor or text editor.
